# Supply Chain Management
## Overview
A company has observed a mismatch between demand and supply in their instant noodles business, resulting in significant losses due to inventory costs. The higher management aims to optimize the quantity of product shipments from various warehouses across the country.

## Goals
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

*	Perform a comprehensive Data Science process, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and visualization.
*	Uncover and highlight trends within the dataset, providing valuable insights and innovative approaches employed during the analysis.
*	Propose future steps and potential enhancements to refine and extend the supply optimization model.
*	Apply a variety of machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model that determines the optimal product shipment weight.
*	Evaluate the model using the provided test dataset.
These goals aim to help the company address supply-demand imbalances, reduce inventory costs, and make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

## Data and Libraries
*	Data: The project uses both a train dataset for model development and a test dataset for evaluation.

*	Libraries: Key libraries utilized in this project include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

## Project Workflow
*	Data Exploration: We begin by exploring the dataset to understand its characteristics, identify patterns, and discover insights that can guide the optimization process.
*	Data Processing: Data preprocessing involves cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming the dataset to make it suitable for machine learning.
*	Model Development: We develop and train machine learning models using various algorithms to predict the optimum weight of product shipments from warehouses.
*	Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using the test dataset to determine the accuracy and effectiveness of the predictive model.
*	Visualization: Throughout the project, we employ data visualization to illustrate findings, trends, and results in a clear and interpretable manner.
*	
By leveraging data-driven insights and machine learning, this project aims to assist the company in making informed decisions to streamline its supply chain and reduce losses associated with inventory costs.
